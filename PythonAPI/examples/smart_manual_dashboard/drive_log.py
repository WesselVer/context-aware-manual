"""Logs a participant's drive and scores how they drive.

manual_control_driver.py --participant P07 starts a DriveLog when the
manual is first started (B), and from then on calls DriveLog.frame() once a
frame with the dashboard state and what it measured in the world (the
probe):

  speed        km/h
  limit        the speed limit where the car is, km/h (Vehicle.get_speed_limit)
  lateral      m from the centre of the lane, + right (from the map's waypoint)
  lane         the lane the car is in, 'road:section:lane'
  junction     the car is in a junction
  lead         (gap in m, speed in km/h) of the car ahead in the lane, or None
  a_long       m/s2 along the car, - braking (Vehicle.get_acceleration)
  steer        -1..1, the steering applied
  indicating   a blinker is on
  brake_pedal  0..1, the driver's own brake, before cruise control and regen
  x, y         m

and DriveLog.event() with each collision and lane crossing its sensors
report. The manual runs as usual: that is the guided phase. F starts the
free drive: the manual pauses for FREE_DRIVE_SECONDS, or until F again,
while the participant drives as they like, and the drive is then scored and
the score shown in
the tip panel as a final tip. The log goes on until the driver script ends.

The participant's folder (study_data/P07/) gets
  drive-<time>.csv    the probe and the state, SAMPLE_HZ times a second
  events-<time>.csv   phases, tips shown and done, features used, assists
                      handed back, collisions and lane crossings
  drive.json          the metrics of each phase and the score, with what
                      each means; report.py reads it

The metrics are the ones the driving-simulator literature uses, from what
CARLA gives: collisions (the collision sensor), close calls (time to
collision with the car ahead under TTC_CRITICAL_S), tailgating (time
headway under THW_SHORT_S), lane keeping (the standard deviation of lateral
position, SDLP, and lane crossings without a blinker from the lane-invasion
sensor), speeding (over the map's limit) and harsh braking. Feature use is
which of the features the tips prompted the participant to try they use
again, and how long the assists were on. score() turns them into five parts of 0-100,
each a plain rule, and the total is their mean.
